# MRes-project2_Yunkai

In this repository, I will include code for generating the figures included in the thesis. The OpenMS package used, as well as the tables of non-canonical peptides identified in this project, are not yet included due to confidentiality requirements, as the data has not been published.

If you have any questions, 关于proteomics searches 或者找到的non-canonical peptide 的sequence, feel free to contact me at: yt1823@ic.ac.uk

## Overview
This repository contains the code used to generate the figures included in my thesis.

## Important Notice
The OpenMS Nextflow pipeline utilized in this project, along with the search results data (such as peptide sequences, corresponding protein accessions, biotypes, Best PSM PEP, FDR, and other related information), is not included in this public GitHub repository due to confidentiality requirements of our research group. If you have any questions regarding the proteomics search results generated in this project, please feel free to contact me at: yt1823@ic.ac.uk.
