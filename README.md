# MRes-project2_Yunkai

In this repository, I will include code for generating the figures included in the thesis. The OpenMS package used, as well as the tables of non-canonical peptides identified in this project, are not yet included due to confidentiality requirements, as the data has not been published.

If you have any questions, 关于proteomics searches 或者找到的non-canonical peptide 的sequence, feel free to contact me at: yt1823@ic.ac.uk
